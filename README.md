# lawn.java
A java program that will interact with the user by taking input from the keyboard, performing some simple calculations, then printing its output to the screen.

The program input will consist of five numbers: the length and width of a rectangular lot, the length and width of a rectangular
house situated on that lot (all linear distances are measured in feet), and the rate at which a lawn on that lot will be mowed (measured in square feet per second.) Assume that all area not occupied by the house is covered by grass. The program will print out two quantities: the lawn area (in square feet), and the mowing time (in hours, minutes, and seconds, rounded to the nearest second.)
